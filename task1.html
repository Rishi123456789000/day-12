           WHY	SMALL	HABITS	MAKE	A	BIG	DIFFERENCE.
           It	is	so	easy	to	overestimate	the	importance	of	one	defining	moment
           and	underestimate	the	value	of	making	small	improvements	on	a	daily
           basis.	Too	often,	we	convince	ourselves	that	massive	success	requires
         massive	action.	Whether	it	is	losing	weight,	building	a	business,
           writing	a	book,	winning	a	championship,	or	achieving	any	other	goal,
         we	put	pressure	on	ourselves	to	make	some	earth-shattering
         improvement	that	everyone	will	talk	about.
         Meanwhile,	improving	by	1	percent	isn’t	particularly	notable—
         sometimes	it	isn’t	even	noticeable—but	it	can	be	far	more	meaningful,
         especially	in	the	long	run.	The	difference	a	tiny	improvement	can	make
         over	time	is	astounding.	Here’s	how	the	math	works	out:	if	you	can	get
         1	percent	better	each	day	for	one	year,	you’ll	end	up	thirty-seven	times
         better	by	the	time	you’re	done.	Conversely,	if	you	get	1	percent	worse
        each	day	for	one	year,	you’ll	decline	nearly	down	to	zero.	What	starts
        as	a	small	win	or	a	minor	setback	accumulates	into	something	much
      more.  WHY	YOUR	BRAIN	BUILDS	HABITS
      A	habit	is	a	behavior	that	has	been	repeated	enough	times	to	become
      automatic.	The	process	of	habit	formation	begins	with	trial	and	error.
      Whenever	you	encounter	a	new	situation	in	life,	your	brain	has	to
      make	a	decision.	How	do	I	respond	to	this?	The	first	time	you	come
      across	a	problem,	you’re	not	sure	how	to	solve	it.	Like	Thorndike’s	cat,
      you’re	just	trying	things	out	to	see	what	works.
      Neurological	activity	in	the	brain	is	high	during	this	period.	You	are
      carefully	analyzing	the	situation	and	making	conscious	decisions	about
      how	to	act.	You’re	taking	in	tons	of	new	information	and	trying	to
      make	sense	of	it	all.	The	brain	is	busy	learning	the	most	effective
      course	of	action.
      Occasionally,	like	a	cat	pressing	on	a	lever,	you	stumble	across	a
      solution.	You’re	feeling	anxious,	and	you	discover	that	going	for	a	run
      calms	you	down.	You’re	mentally	exhausted	from	a	long	day	of	work,
      and	you	learn	that	playing	video	games	relaxes	you.	You’re	exploring,
      exploring,	exploring,	and	then—BAM—a	reward</p>

      <h2>CHAPTER2</h2>
      <p>A	SYSTEM	OF	ATOMIC	HABITS
        If	you re	having	trouble	changing	your	habits,	the	problem	isn’t	you.
        The	problem	is	your	system.	Bad	habits	repeat	themselves	again	and
        again	not	because	you	don’t	want	to	change,	but	because	you	have	the
        wrong	system	for	change.
        You	do	not	rise	to	the	level	of	your	goals.	You	fall	to	the	level	of	your
        systems.
        Focusing	on	the	overall	system,	rather	than	a	single	goal,	is	one	of
        the	core	themes	of	this	book.	It	is	also	one	of	the	deeper	meanings
        behind	the	word	atomic.	By	now,	you’ve	probably	realized	that	an
        atomic	habit	refers	to	a	tiny	change,	a	marginal	gain,	a	1	percent
        improvement.	But	atomic	habits	are	not	just	any	old	habits,	however
        small.	They	are	little	habits	that	are	part	of	a	larger	system.	Just	as
        atoms	are	the	building	blocks	of	molecules,	atomic	habits	are	the
        building	blocks	of	remarkable	results.
        Habits	are	like	the	atoms	of	our	lives.	Each	one	is	a	fundamental
        unit	that	contributes	to	your	overall	improvement.	At	first,	these	tiny
        routines	seem	insignificant,	but	soon	they	build	on	each	other	and	fuel
        bigger	wins	that	multiply	to	a	degree	that	far	outweighs	the	cost	of
        their	initial	investment.	They	are	both	small	and	mighty.	This	is	the
        meaning	of	the	phrase	atomic	habits—a	regular	practice	or	routine
        that	is	not	only	small	and	easy	to	do,	but	also	the	source	of	incredible
        power;	a	component	of	the	system	of	compound	growth.</p>

            <h2> CHAPTER3</h2>
             <p> THE	REAL	REASON	HABITS	MATTER
            Identity	change	is	the	North	Star	of	habit	change.	The	remainder	of
            this	book	will	provide	you	with	step-by-step	instructions	on	how	to
            build	better	habits	in	yourself,	your	family,	your	team,	your	company,
            and	anywhere	else	you	wish.	But	the	true	question	is:	“Are	you
            becoming	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	become?”	The	first	step	is	not
            what	or	how,	but	who.	You	need	to	know	who	you	want	to	be.
            Otherwise,	your	quest	for	change	is	like	a	boat	without	a	rudder.	And
            that’s	why	we	are	starting	here.
            You	have	the	power	to	change	your	beliefs	about	yourself.	Your
            identity	is	not	set	in	stone.	You	have	a	choice	in	every	moment.	You
            can	choose	the	identity	you	want	to	reinforce	today	with	the	habits	you
            choose	today.	And	this	brings	us	to	the	deeper	purpose	of	this	book
            and	the	real	reason	habits	matter.
            Chapter	Summary
            There	are	three	levels	of	change:	outcome	change,	process	change,
            and	identity	change.
            The	most	effective	way	to	change	your	habits	is	to	focus	not	on
            what	you	want	to	achieve,	but	on	who	you	wish	to	become.
            Your	identity	emerges	out	of	your	habits.	Every	action	is	a	vote	for
            the	type	of	person	you	wish	to	become.
            Becoming	the	best	version	of	yourself	requires	you	to
            continuously	edit	your	beliefs,	and	to	upgrade	and	expand	your
            identity.
            The	real	reason	habits	matter	is	not	because	they	can	get	you
            better	results	(although	they	can	do	that),	but	because	they	can
            change	your	beliefs	about	yourself.
            THE	PSYCHOLOGIST	GARY	Klein	once	told	me	a	story	about	a	woman	who
            attended	a	family	gathering.	She	had	spent	years	working	as	a
            paramedic	and,	upon	arriving	at	the	event,	took	one	look	at	her	father
           in-law	and	got	very	concerned.
            “I	don’t	like	the	way	you	look,”	she	said.
            Her	father-in-law,	who	was	feeling	perfectly	fine,	jokingly	replied,
            “Well,	I	don’t	like	your	looks,	either.”
            “No,”	she	insisted.	“You	need	to	go	to	the	hospital	now.”
            A	few	hours	later,	the	man	was	undergoing	lifesaving	surgery	after
            an	examination	had	revealed	that	he	had	a	blockage	to	a	major	artery
            and	was	at	immediate	risk	of	a	heart	attack.	Without	his	daughter-in
           law’s	intuition,	he	could	have	died.
            What	did	the	paramedic	see?	How	did	she	predict	his	impending
            heart	attack?
            When	major	arteries	are	obstructed,	the	body	focuses	on	sending
            blood	to	critical	organs	and	away	from	peripheral	locations	near	the
            surface	of	the	skin.	The	result	is	a	change	in	the	pattern	of	distribution
            of	blood	in	the	face.	After	many	years	of	working	with	people	with
            heart	failure,	the	woman	had	unknowingly	developed	the	ability	to
            recognize	this	pattern	on	sight.	She	couldn’t	explain	what	it	was	that
            she	noticed	in	her	father-in-law’s	face,	but	she	knew	something	was
            wrong
